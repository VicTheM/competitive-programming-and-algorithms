# Data Structures

This directory contains implementations of various data structures used in competitive programming.

## Directory Structure

- **linear/**: Arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, deques
- **trees/**: Binary trees, BSTs, segment trees, Fenwick trees, tries
- **graphs/**: Graph representations and specialized graph data structures
- **heaps/**: Min/max heaps, priority queues
- **hash-tables/**: Hash map implementations and related structures

## Implementation Guidelines

- Focus on functionality needed for competitive programming
- Include common operations with time complexity analysis
- Provide clear examples of usage
- Test implementations thoroughly
