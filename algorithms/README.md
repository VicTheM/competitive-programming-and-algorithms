# Algorithms

This directory contains implementations of fundamental algorithms commonly used in competitive programming and software development.

## Directory Structure

- **graph/**: Graph algorithms (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, Floyd-Warshall, MST, etc.)
- **dynamic-programming/**: Dynamic programming solutions and patterns
- **greedy/**: Greedy algorithms and optimization problems
- **string/**: String processing algorithms (KMP, Z-algorithm, suffix arrays, etc.)
- **sorting/**: Various sorting algorithms implementations
- **searching/**: Binary search and other searching techniques
- **math/**: Mathematical algorithms (number theory, combinatorics, etc.)

## Implementation Guidelines

- Each algorithm should be well-documented with complexity analysis
- Include example usage and test cases
- Prefer clear, readable code over micro-optimizations
- Add comments explaining the algorithm's key concepts
